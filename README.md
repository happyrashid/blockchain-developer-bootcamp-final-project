Gnosis Safe Implementation for Testing Smart Contract Concepts
This simplified Gnosis Safe implementation is designed to test a developer's understanding of core smart contract concepts, multi-signature functionality, and approval workflows.

Target Audience: Developers seeking to demonstrate their proficiency in smart contract development.

# Concepts Tested:

Multi-signature Wallets: Managing funds with multiple owner accounts requiring a certain number of confirmations.
Transaction Execution: Proposing, confirming, and executing transactions.
Modifiers and Access Control: Ensuring proper authorization for different functionalities.
Events: Logging significant actions on the blockchain.
Data Structures: Efficiently storing and retrieving data.
Simplified Safe Functionality:

# Initialization:
The Safe is created with a list of owner addresses.
A threshold (number of required confirmations) is set during creation.
Transaction Proposal:
Any owner can propose a transaction.

# A transaction includes:
Destination address
Value (ETH amount)
Data (function call data for interacting with other contracts)

# Transaction Confirmation:
Owners can confirm a proposed transaction.
Confirmations are stored, and duplicates from the same owner are ignored.

# Transaction Execution:
Once a transaction reaches the required confirmation threshold, any owner can execute it.
Executed transactions cannot be executed again.
Adding/Removing Owners:(Optional, advanced feature)
Owners can propose to add or remove an owner address.
Requires a specific threshold of confirmations from existing owners (can be a different threshold than for regular transactions).
Changing Threshold:(Optional, advanced feature)
Owners can propose to change the required confirmation threshold.
Requires a specific threshold of confirmations.
